        There seems to be something inherently communicative about computation:
        we speak of programming <em>languages</em>, each with their own{" "}
        <em>syntax</em> and <em>grammar</em>; the <em>declaration</em> of
        variables; and the <em>parsing</em> of data.
      </p>
      <p>
        And when we turn back the clock to the first computer interfaces, we see
        that computers began as simple command lines, telegram-type technologies
        that sent signals over the wire for us humans to receive on the other
        end (Stephenson 5-6). It seems that, fundamentally, computers and humans
        are, and have always been, "communication partners" (Esposito 16).
