        From the telegraph to HAL 9000 and now ChatGPT, it seems that, since the
        advent of computing, there has always been a fear of the computer as an
        intelligent being destined to bring about the end of the human race. But
        are computers truly intelligent? What is a computer? And what forces
        govern the ways in which we interact with our computers?
      </p>
      <p>
        Elena Esposito pushes back against the term "artificial intelligence,"
        instead offering the concept of "artificial communication," which builds
        on Niklas Luhmann's theory of communication as something that "comes
        about not when somebody says something, but when somebody understands
        that someone said something" (Esposito 21). Computers are not
        intelligent; they do not understand the text that they display
        on-screen, or the data that they process as input into machine learning
        models. But they do communicate.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>My thesis is this:</b> If computation is communication, the computer
        is a meaning-making metaphor machine. And if the computer is a metaphor,
        we can borrow words from language and literature to come to a better
        understanding of the ways in which humans interact with digital devices.
        But because a computer does not and <em>cannot</em> understand the data
        that it transmits, its metaphor is incomplete without a human on the
        receiving end. In this mode of communication, there is no meaning in the
        absence of humanity.
      </p>

        <b>
          For a study of the ways in which we interact with computers, what
          better medium could there be than the computer itself?
        </b>{" "}
        And in computation, what device more metaphorical can there be than the
        graphical user interface (GUI)? So, for my Media Studies capstone
        project, I bring you this website resembling a computer desktop.

        As you click through, you'll explore the throughline of computers as
        communication partners from present-day GUIs, all the way back to the
        command line â€” while learning about the mechanisms underlying our daily
        interactions with our computers (e.g., the bits hidden under the GUI's
        hood). Along the way, you'll also discover a subset of my meaning-making
        computational lexicon: erasure, translation, and perhaps most
        importantly, dialogue.
