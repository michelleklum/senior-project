        <b>Communicative Computing:</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>This site is about humans and machines.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        From the telegraph to HAL 9000 and now ChatGPT, it seems that, since the
        advent of computing, there has always been a fear of the computer as an
        intelligent being destined to bring about the end of the human race. But
        are computers truly intelligent? <b>What is a computer?</b> And what
        forces govern the ways in which humans interact with computers?
      </p>
      <p>
        Elena Esposito pushes back against the idea of artificial intelligence,
        instead offering the idea of <b>artificial communication</b>, building
        on Niklas Luhmann's theory of communication as something that "comes
        about not when somebody says something, but when somebody understands
        that someone said something" (Esposito 21). Computers are not
        intelligent; they do not understand the text that they display
        on-screen, or the data that they process as input into machine learning
        models. But they do communicate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Indeed, there seems to be something inherently communicative about
        computation: we speak of programming <em>languages</em>, each with their
        own <em>syntax</em> and <em>grammar</em>; the <em>declaration</em> of
        variables; and the <em>parsing</em> of data. And when we turn back the
        clock to the first computer interfaces, we see that computers began as
        simple command lines, telegram-type technologies that sent signals over
        the wire for us humans to receive on the other end (Stephenson 5-6). It
        seems that, fundamentally, computers and humans are, and have always
        been, "communication partners" (Esposito 16).
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>My thesis is this:</b> If computation is communication, the computer
        is a meaning-making metaphor machine. And if the computer is a metaphor,
        we can borrow words from language and literature to come to a better
        understanding of the ways in which humans interact with digital devices.
        But because a computer does not and <em>cannot</em> understand the data
        that it transmits, its metaphor is incomplete without a human on the
        receiving end. In this mode of communication, there is no meaning
        without humanity.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>
          For a study of the ways in which we interact with computers, what
          better medium could there be than the computer itself?
        </b>{" "}
        And in computation, what device more metaphorical can there be than the
        graphical user interface (GUI)? So, for my Media Studies capstone
        project, I bring you this website resembling a computer desktop.
      </p>
      <p>
        As you click through, you'll explore the throughline of computers as
        communication partners from present-day GUIs, all the way back to the
        command line.
      </p>
      <p>
        Along the way, you'll learn about the mechanisms underlying our daily
        interactions with our computers (i.e., the bits hidden under the GUI's
        hood), while discovering a subset of my meaning-making computational
        lexicon: erasure, translation, and perhaps most importantly, dialogue.
