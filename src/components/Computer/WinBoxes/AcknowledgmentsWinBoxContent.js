        Thank you to my wonderful friend Zoe Tokheim, for inspiring me to do
        this project in the first place, one year ago, when she first showed me{" "}

        I also owe a big thank you to my Media Studies advisor, Ryan Engley,
        who, despite being on sabbatical this year, was never more than a call
        or an email away. Thank you for being willing to take me on as an
        off-campus Media Studies advisee, and for sending me the reading
        recommendations that formed the basis of my thesis. Without you, I don't
        know where this project — and I — would be. You were the best Media
        Studies advisor I could have asked for.
      </p>
      <p>
        I would also like to acknowledge my Media Studies Senior Seminar section
        advisor, Rachel Mayeri, for her support throughout the semester, as well
        as my fellow peer group members Carson French and Charlie O'Brien.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thank you to Tiffany Madruga and William La for paving the way for me
        and other future Computer Science + Media Studies majors to come. Thank
        you to Waverly Wang for doing this whole double major journey with me,
        and for constantly inspiring me with her passion and talent for art.
        Also, thanks to Anshul Kamath for generously sharing his Media Studies
        course readings (all of which, sadly, I have yet to read) with me as I
        was in the process of formulating my thesis.
      </p>
      <p>
        Shoutout to Neil Rhodes' Interaction Design course, Nancy Macko's
        Introduction to Digital Art course, Aly Ogasian's Intermediate Digital
        Art course, and my high school journalism classmates for teaching me the
        skills required to complete this project.
      </p>
      <p>
        And much appreciation goes to Lucas Bang for his interest in each and
        every one of my adventures in Media Studies these past two years, as
        well as Avani Anne, Shivani Manivasagan, and my other Muddraker kids for
        all your love and support.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, thank you to all my other friends and family who felt,
        firsthand, the effects of the stress that this project had on me. Thank
        you for your encouragement and understanding, and for bearing with me
        through this difficult final semester of college.
